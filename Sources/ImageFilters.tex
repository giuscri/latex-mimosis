\chapter{Image filters as a defense against adversarial input}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this chapter we'll test a couple of image filter techniques as a
defense against adversarial input. The intuition behind this idea is
that to forge an adversarial input the attacker will try to put noise
in \emph{portions} of the image that carry the least information --
intuitively to be stealthy. By cutting out that information for every
image we hope to reduce the probability of success for the attacker, as
we would filter out part of the noise of adversarial input.
