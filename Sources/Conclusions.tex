This work took more or less three months, basically a student's summer.
This has been my first experience with Machine Learning so I had to
spend some time learning about fundamentals of Machine Learning: what's
the training set? A validation set? The learning rate of the gradient
descent algorithm? Or simply what's a neural network?

The research that I proposed to my advisors was an attempt to merge the
curiosity of what's a hot topic right now --- Machine Learning and
neural networks --- with my passion of watching computers break. I find
that the topic of adversarial examples can be as fascinating to
security interested people just like a memory corruption can be. Tools
and culture is a lot different from the traditional hacker one but I
think that if Machine Learning will become more ubiquitous more
security researchers will join the field\footnote{``Weaponizing Machine
  Learning'', talk at DEF CON 25}.

As to me, this work was the shortcut to learn about Neural Networks. I
had some book titles that I wanted to read by the summer but when
presented the opportunity to learn about that same topic hands-on I
couldn't resist. A lot of time has been used to glue different
libraries together, reading documentations and trying to not depress
when confronted with crazy long researchers' papers.
